				<h2>This is an infographic site concerning</h2>
					<img src="images/dep.svg" />
				<p>This is a topic that has been debated for millenia. The chronic behavioral pattern of sadness and disconnection is one that has been misunderstood, punished, persecuted, misinterpreted and given little credit as a legitimate medical concern.</p>
				<p>Herein will be explored the sistory, statistics, symptoms, and information on what sctions can be taken for those with this mental illness. There are many key indicators, or signs, to look for with identifying depression in yourself or others.</p><hr>
				<h2>There are two audiences in consideration here</h2><hr>
					<ol>
						<li>Those who have depression, knowingly or not.</li>
						<li>Those who do not have it, but would like to know more.</li>
					</ol>
					<p>There is a phrase used here, "Knowledge is Power", wherein it is a cal to action for those reading on. Keep yourself informed, be up-to-date, and be mindful of a mental illness that is secretive by nature. Maybe you will discover habits in your own behavior, or realize a friend/family member showing the same signs. Either way, knowledge will enable you to act.</p>
				<hr><h2>The purposes of this micro-site are:</h2><hr>
				<ol>
					<li>Give a brief history into how Depression has been identified.</li>
					<li>Display statistics about how many people are affected by this in the US.</li>
					<li>Address the common symptoms that someone with Depression would feel, as well as signs to look for in others.</li>
					<li>A "Call-to-Action" page, in which either you have Depression yourself, or would like to know more, this is what to do with the knowledge you've obtained.</li>
				</ol><hr>
				<h2>So whatever your situation...</h2>
