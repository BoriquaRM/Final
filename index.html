				<p>Some need-to-know definitions about what depression feels like:</p>
				<ol>
					<li><i>Depression</i> - feelings of severe despondency and dejection.</li>
					<li><i>Despondency</i> - a state of low spirits caused by loss of hope or courage.</li>
					<li><i>Dejection</i> - a sad state of low spirits.</li>
				</ol>
				<p>This is a topic that has been debated for millennia. The chronic behavioral pattern of sadness and disconnection is one that has been misunderstood, punished, persecuted, misinterpreted and given little credit as a legitimate medical concern.</p>

					</div>
				</div>
					<ol>
						<li>Those who have depression, knowingly or not.</li>
						<li>Those who do not have it, but would like to know more.</li>
					</ol>
					<p>There is a phrase used here, "Knowledge is Power", wherein it is a call to action for those reading on. Keep yourself informed, be up-to-date, and be mindful of a mental illness that is secretive by nature. Maybe you will discover habits in your own behavior, or realize a friend/family member showing the same signs.</p>
					<p>Either way, knowledge will enable you to act.</p>
				<hr><h2>The purposes of this site are:</h2><hr>
				<ol>
					<li>Give a brief history into how Depression has been identified / treated over the years.</li>
					<li>Display statistics about how many people are affected by depressive behavior in the US each year, as well as address some common symptoms that someone with Depression would feel and the outward signs to look for.</li>
					<li>A "Call-to-Action" page, in which the knowledge you've gained can be put to use.</li>
