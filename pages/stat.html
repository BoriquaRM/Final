				<h2>THE AVERAGE U.S. POPULATION<br>affected by Depression</h2>
				<hr>
				<p>The average total population of the U.S. is <b class="yearbold">300<sup> million</sup></b></p>

						<p><b class="yearbold">7.1<sup>%</sup></b> of the population is registered, or admitted, to be depressed. And this number is just the ones that are known of.</p>
						<p><b class="yearbold">17.3<sup> million</sup></b> people, from child to adult. Too many go through life without knowing that their grief is a mental illness, and one that can be treated.</p>
					</div>

					<div class="grid-item">
						<p><b class="yearbold">9.1<sup>%</sup></b> of the number of depressed people are <i>children</i> from the ages of 8-17.</p>

				<h1>The ratio of depression among men and women<br><b class="yearbold">2 : 1</b></h1>
				<p>Reasons for this could be that childbirth includes port-pardom depression, in which the hormones involved with creating life are suddenly thrown out of balance, and the mother is left with a sense of loss.</p>
				<h1>The older generation is less represented</h1>
				<p>With a noticible drop in age representation, it is a clear indicator that depression and suicide likely have this common denominator, as the elderly cannot cope with the extreme levels of sadness and loss.</p>
