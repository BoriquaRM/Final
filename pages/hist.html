					<h2>THE EARLIEST RECORD<br>of depressive behavior</h2>

						<p>The discovery of Depression is not a singular event, nor an event that can be attributed to any one person or civilization. However, the furthest record of this behavior goes back as far as 2000 bc, in ancient Mesopotamia.</p>
						<p>Superstition governed much of what could not be logically explained, and so theories such as demons, spirits, or an imbalance of the soul was assumed. An "imbalance of the soul" that needed spiritual correction.</p>
						<p>Unfortunetely, spiritual correction in those days meant physical torment. Depression was treated with beating, physical restraint and even starvation.</p>

						<p>After many centuries, science and medicine advanced, as well as philosophy, which curbed much of the superstition about what causes this immense saddness. A man by the name of Hippocrates conceived the idea that Depression may not be a spiritual imbalance, but a physical one; specifically in the body's fluids.</p>
						<p>Treatments involved gymnastics, massage, diet, music, baths, and a medication that contained poppy extract and donkey's milk.</p>
						<p>While not fully formed, this was the first major step in taking Depression seriously as a medical issue.</p>

						<p>In a step backwards, this age reverted back to abusive measures in order to "cure" depression. Victims of this would be shunned and locked up, given to the belief that the root of the problem was aggression.</p>
						<p>More barbaric treatments included near-drowning, spun on swivel-chair to induce dizziness, and even an early form of electro-shock therapy.</p>
						<p>One small improvement was the additional push for being physically active, with exercise, diet, enemas and vomiting. At the very least, it was healthier than the alternative.</p>

					<h2>Depression is taken seriously now</h2>
					<p>After centuries of observation and opinions, the modern age of science and medicine has given greater insights into this now-accepted mental illness that we know today.</p>

							<p>A great deal of research has now gone in to the root cause, symptoms, treatments and statistics of what causes depression, as well as what can be done to keep it in check.</p>
