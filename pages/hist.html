						<p class="content">"The earliest written accounts of what is now known as depression appeared in the second millennium B.C. in Mesopotamia. In these writings, depression was discussed as a spiritual rather than a physical condition. Like other mental illnesses, it was believed to be caused by demonic possession. As such, it was dealt with by priests rather than physicians.<br><br>The idea of depression being caused by demons and evil spirits has existed in many cultures, including the ancient Greeks, Romans, Babylonians, Chinese, and Egyptians. Because of this belief, it was often treated with methods such as beatings, physical restraint, and starvation in an attempt to drive the demons out.</p>

						<p class="content">A Greek physician by the name of Hippocrates was credited for the idea that depression was not a spiritual imbalance, but one of bodily fluids; a physical imbalance. According to <a href="https://www.verywellmind.com/who-discovered-depression-1066770#earliest-accounts-of-depression">The History of Depression</a>: "Greek and Roman doctors used therapeutic methods such as gymnastics, massage, diet, music, baths, and a medication containing poppy extract and donkey's milk to treat their patients."</p>
